School Data Management System
Problem Statement
In our school, managing data among teachers, students, and parents has become increasingly challenging. Accessing personal and academic data is cumbersome for everyone involved, leading to frustration and inefficiencies.

Solution
To address this issue, I have developed a web application that allows users—students, parents, and teachers—to easily access and manage their data. This website streamlines the process, ensuring that everyone can retrieve the information they need quickly and efficiently.

MVP Features
User Authentication:

Secure login system for students, parents, and teachers.
Course Enrollment:

Students can enroll in courses directly through the platform.
Fee Balance Check:

Parents can view their child’s fee balance at any time.
Marks Management:

Teachers can add and update marks for students.
Marks Viewing:

Users can view their own or their child’s marks.
Technical Expectations
Programming Language: Python
Database: SQLAlchemy for database management and interaction.
Command Line Interface (CLI): For initial setup and management tasks.
Documentation: A README.md file will be included to guide users on how to set up and use the application.
